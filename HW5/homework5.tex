\begin{problem}[Expectation-Maximization for Gamma Mixture Models, 25pts]

In this problem we will explore expectation-maximization for a Categorical-Gamma Mixture model.

Let us suppose the following generative story for an observation $x$: first one of $K$ classes is randomly selected, and then the features $x$ are sampled according to this class. If $$z \sim \operatorname{Categorical}(\btheta)$$ indicates the selected class, then $x$ is sampled according to the class or ``component'' distribution corresponding to $z$. (Here, $\btheta$ is the mixing proportion over the $K$ components: $\sum_k \theta_k = 1$ and $ \theta_k > 0$). In this problem, we assume these component distributions are gamma distributions with shared shape parameter but different rate parameters: $$x | z \sim \operatorname{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta_k).$$

In an unsupervised setting, we are only given a set of observables as our training dataset: $\mathcal D = \{x_n\}_{n=1}^N$. The EM algorithm allows us to learn the underlying generative process (the parameters $\btheta$ and $\{\beta_k\}$) despite not having the latent variables $\{z_n\}$ corresponding to our training data.

\vspace{2em}

\begin{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{Intractability of the Data Likelihood} We are
    generally interested in finding a set of parameters $\beta_k$ that
    maximizes the likelihood of the observed data: $$\log
    p(\{x_n\}^N_{n=1}; \btheta, \{\beta_k\}^K_{k = 1}).$$ Expand the data
    likelihood to include the necessary sums over observations
    $x_n$ and to marginalize out the latents
    $\boldz_n$. Why is optimizing this likelihood directly
    intractable?

\item \textbf{Complete Data Log Likelihood} The complete dataset
  $\mathcal D = \{(x_n, \boldz_n)\}_{n=1}^N$ includes latents $\boldz_n$. Write
  out the negative complete data log likelihood: $$\mcL(\btheta, \{\beta_k\}^K_{k=1}) =  -\log p(\mathcal D; \btheta, \{\beta_k\}^K_{k=1}).$$

  Apply the power trick and simplify your expression using indicator elements $z_{n
  k}$.\footnote{The ``power trick'' is used when terms in a PDF are raised to the power of indicator components of a one-hot vector.  For example, it allows us to rewrite $p(\boldz_n ;  \btheta) = \prod_k \theta_k^{z_{nk}}$.} Notice that optimizing this loss is now computationally tractable if we know $\boldz_n$.

  (Continued on next page.)

\begin{framed}
\noindent\textbf{Problem 1} (cont.)\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item[3.] \textbf{Expectation Step} Our next step is to introduce a
  mathematical expression for $\boldq_n$, the posterior over the
  hidden component variables~$\boldz_n$ conditioned on the observed data
  $x_n$ with fixed parameters.
That is:
  \begin{align*}
    \textbf{q}_n &= \begin{bmatrix}
      p(\boldz_n =\boldC_1| x_n; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}^K_{k=1}) \\
      \vdots \\
      p(\boldz_n =\boldC_K| x_n; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}^K_{k=1})
    \end{bmatrix}.
  \end{align*}
  %
%
  Write down and simplify the expression for
  $\boldq_n$.  Note that because the $\boldq_n$ represents the
  posterior over the hidden categorical variables $\boldz_n$, the
  components of vector $\boldq_n$ must sum to 1.
  The main work is to find an expression for $p(\boldz_n|x_n; \btheta, \{\beta_k\}^K_{k=1})$  for any choice of $\boldz_n$; i.e., for any 1-hot encoded $\boldz_n$. With this, you can then construct the different components that make up the vector $\boldq_n$.
  
\item[4.] \textbf{Maximization Step}
Using the~$\boldq_n$ estimates from the Expectation Step, derive an update for maximizing the expected complete data log likelihood in terms of $\btheta$ and $\{ \beta_k \}^K_{k=1}$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Derive an expression for the expected complete data log likelihood using $\boldq_n$.
    \item Find an expression for $\btheta$ that maximizes this expected complete data log likelihood. You may find it helpful to use Lagrange multipliers in order to enforce the constraint $\sum \theta_k = 1$. Why does this optimal $\btheta$ make intuitive sense?
    \item Find an expression for $\beta_k$ that maximizes the expected complete data log likelihood.  Why does this optimal $\beta_k$  make intuitive sense?
\end{enumerate}
    
\item[5.] Suppose that this had been a classification problem. That is,
  you were provided the ``true'' components $\boldz_n$ for each
  observation $x_n$,
  and you were going to perform the classification by
  inverting the provided generative model (i.e. now you're predicting $\boldz_n$ given $x_n$). Could you reuse any of
  your derivations above to estimate the parameters of the model?
  

\item[6.] Finally, implement your solution in \texttt{p1.ipynb} and attach the final plot below.

{\bfseries You will recieve no points for code not included below.}

\subsection*{Solution}

\subsection*{Problem 1.1}

We want to expand the data likelihood to include the sums over observations $x_n$ and marginalize out the latents $\vb{z}_n$.
\begin{align*}
    p(\{ x_n \} ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}) &= \prod_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K p(x_n, \vb{z}_n; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}) \\
    \log(p(\{ x_n \} ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \})) &= \sum_{n=1}^N \log(\sum_{k=1}^K p(x_n, \vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k) \}) \\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N \log(\sum_{k=1}^K p(x_n | \vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}) p(\vb{z}_n | \btheta, \{ \beta_k \})) \\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N \log(\sum_{k=1}^K \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k) \theta_k)
\end{align*}
Optimizing this likelihood is directly intractable because of the summation within the $\log$.

\subsection*{Problem 1.2}

We want to write out the negative complete data log likelihood and apply the power trick to simplify our expression using indicator elements $z_{n k}$.
\begin{align*}
    p(\{x_n\}, \{ \vb{z}_n \} ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}) &= \prod_{n=1}^N p(x_n, \vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}) \\
    &= \prod_{n=1}^N p(x_n | \vb{z}_n; \{ \beta_k \}) p(\vb{z}_n ; \btheta)\\
    &= \prod_{n=1}^N \prod_{k=1}^K \left(\text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k) \theta_k \right)^{z_{n k}}\\
    -\log p(\{x_n\}, \{ \vb{z}_n \} ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \}) &= -\sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K z_{n k} \log \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k) + z_{n k} \log \theta_k
\end{align*}
And so we have written the complete negative log likelihood.

\subsection*{Problem 1.3}

We want to write down and simplify the expression for $\vb{q}_n$. Let us work with a single element $q_{n k}$ of $\vb{q}_n$ and then assemble these elements into a vector at the end.
\begin{align*}
    q_{n k} &= p(\vb{z}_n = C_k | x_n ; \btheta, \beta_k) \\
    &= p(x_n | \vb{z_n} = C_k ; \beta_k) p(\vb{z}_n = C_k ; \btheta) \\
    &= \theta_k \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k)
\end{align*}
We also need to make sure to normalize the elements of $\vb{q}_n$ since we know that $\sum_{k=1}^K q_{n k} = 1$. And so we have the following expression for $\vb{q}_n$.
\begin{equation*}
    \vb{q}_n = \begin{bmatrix}
        \theta_1 \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_1) / \left(\sum_{k=1}^K \theta_k \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k)\right) \\
        \vdots \\
        \theta_K \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_K) / \left(\sum_{k=1}^K \theta_k \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k)\right)
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

\subsection*{Problem 1.4(a)}

We want to derive an expression for the expected complete data log likelihood using $\vb{q}_n$.
\begin{align*}
    \E_{\{x_n\}, \{\vb{z}_n\}}[\log p(\{x_n\}, \{ \vb{z}_n \} ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \})] &= \E_{\{x_n\}, \{\vb{z}_n\}}\left[\sum_{n=1}^N \log\left(p(x_n | \vb{z}_n; \{ \beta_k \}) p(\vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{\beta_k\})\right)\right]\\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N \E_{x_n | \vb{z}_n}\left[ \log p(x_n | \vb{z}_n ; \{\beta_k\}) + \log p(\vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{\beta_k \} \}) \right] \\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K p(\vb{z}_n = C_k | x_n) \left[\log p(x_n | \vb{z}_n ; \{\beta_k\}) + \log p(\vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{\beta_k \} \})\right] \\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K q_{n k} \log p(x_n | \vb{z}_n ; \{\beta_k\}) + q_{n k} \log p(\vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{\beta_k \} \})
\end{align*}
This uses $q_{n k} = p(\vb{z}_n = C_k | x_n)$ to simplify notation. And so we are done.

\subsection*{Problem 1.4(b)}
We want to find an expression for $\btheta$ that maximizes this expected complete data log likelihood. We will use Lagrange multipliers and enforce the constraint $\sum_{i=1}^K \theta_k = 1$.

Let us set up a Lagrange multiplier function $L$.
\begin{equation*}
    L(\{x_n\}, \lambda) = \left[\sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K q_{n k} \log p(x_n | \vb{z}_n ; \{\beta_k\}) + q_{n k} \log p(\vb{z}_n ; \btheta, \{\beta_k \} \})\right] - \lambda\left(\left[\sum_{k=1}^K\theta_k\right] - 1 \right)
\end{equation*}
Now take the derivative with respect to $\lambda$, set the LHS to $0$, and rearrange.
\begin{align*}
    \nabla_{\lambda}L(\{x_n\}, \lambda) &= 1 - \sum_{k=1}^K \theta_k \\
    \sum_{k=1}^K \theta_k &= 1
\end{align*}
Then we take the derivative with respect to $\theta_k$.
\begin{align*}
    \nabla_{\theta_k}L(\{x_n\}, \lambda) &= \left[ \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{q_{n k}}{\theta_k} \right] - \lambda\\
    \lambda &= \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{q_{n k}}{\theta_k}\\
    \theta_k &= \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k}}{\lambda}
\end{align*}
Subbing this into our expression above, we get the following value of $\lambda$.
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{k=1}^K \theta_k &= 1\\
    \sum_{k=1}^K \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k}}{\lambda} &= 1\\
    \lambda &= \sum_{k=1}^K \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k}\\
    \lambda &= N
\end{align*}
Finally, we sub this into our expression for $\theta_k$.
\begin{align*}
    \theta_k &= \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k}}{\lambda}\\
    \theta_k &= \frac{\sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k}}{N}
\end{align*}
And so we have found an expression for $\btheta$ (a vector of these $\theta_k$ for each $k$) that maximizes the expected complete data log likelihood.

This expression makes sense because it is essentially the average probability for each class across the data set. Since $\theta_k$ is the probability for a given class because our latent variables are categorical, then this is appropriate.

\subsection*{Problem 1.4(c)}

We want to find an expression for $\beta_k$ that maximizes the expected complete data log likelihood. Let $E$ be our complete data log likelihood.
\begin{align*}
    E &= \E_{\{x_n\}, \{\vb{z}_n\}}[\log p(\{x_n\}, \{ \vb{z}_n \} ; \btheta, \{ \beta_k \})]\\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N \sum_{k=1}^K q_{n k} \log \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k) + q_{n k} \log \theta_k \\
    \nabla_{\beta_k}E &= \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} \left[\frac{\nabla_{\beta_k} \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k)}{\text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k)}  \right]
\end{align*}
We use the product rule to differentiate the Gamma PDF.
\begin{align*}
    \text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k) &= \frac{x_n^{\alpha - 1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)}\beta_k^{\alpha}e^{-\beta_k x_n}\\
    \nabla_{\beta_k}\text{Gamma}(x_n | \alpha, \beta_k) &= \frac{x_n^{\alpha - 1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \left[ \alpha \beta_k^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\beta_k x_n} - x \beta_k^{\alpha} e^{- \beta_k x_n} \right]\\
    &= \frac{x_n^{\alpha - 1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \left[ \beta_k^{\alpha - 1}e^{-\beta_k x_n}(\alpha - x_n \beta_k) \right]
\end{align*}
Then we can plug this back in, simplify, set the LHS to 0, and solve for $\beta_k$.
\begin{align*}
    \nabla_{\beta_k}E &= \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} \left[\frac{\beta_k^{\alpha - 1}e^{-\beta_k x_n}(\alpha - x_n \beta_k)}{\beta_k^{\alpha} e^{-\beta_k x}}\right]\\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} \left[ \frac{\alpha - x_n \beta_k}{\beta_k}\right]\\
    &= \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} \left[ \frac{\alpha}{\beta_k} - x_n\right]\\
    0 &= \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} \frac{\alpha}{\beta_k} - \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} x_n \\
    \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} x_n &= \frac{\alpha}{\beta_k} \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} \\
    \beta_k &= \frac{\alpha \sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k}}{\sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} x_n}
\end{align*}
To see that this is intuitive, note that we can rearrange the equation above to be in the form $\frac{\sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} x_n}{\sum_{n=1}^N q_{n k} q_{n k}} = \alpha / \beta_k$. We know that the mean of a Gamma distribution is given by $\alpha / \beta$. And so the above value of $\beta_k$ is the value corresponding to the most likely mean of the data for our (where each data point is weighted by the certainty of a data point $x_n$ being a member of class $C_k$).

\subsection*{Problem 1.5}
If we are provided the true components $\vb{z}_n$ for each observation and we were inverting the generative model, then we could reuse all of our derivations to estimate the model parameters except those from the expectation step. The expectation step attempts to find a soft assignment of the data to each class; however, if we are given $\vb{z}_n$, then there is no need to complete this step because we already know the assignment. We may still reuse the derivations in the maximization step since these will find the most likely model for our data.

\begin{problem}[PCA, 15 pts]

% FDV: Here are the notes from last year.  I've already edited to make clear we want L2.  As noted below, we should also provide the baseline/reference to the pset 4 solutions in case they computed that wrong somehow.  
% 
% # problem 2 clarifications
% *NB: There was a lot of confusion about this problem, and we ended up accepting any form of comparison to PCA. Next year should clarify which norm students should use more explicitly (and maybe provide a baseline for students if the computation of the reconstruction error is different from what students calculated on pset4.)*
% 
% For Problem 2.3 (computing PCA reconstruction error), we will accept both the L1 and L2 norm and both summing over the errors for individual images and taking the mean of the errors (as long as you compute the error for K-Means the same way as you compute it for PCA). Apologies for the ambiguity in this question! 

  
For this problem you will implement PCA from scratch on the first 6000 images of the MNIST dataset. Your job is to apply PCA on MNIST and discuss what kind of structure is found. Implement your solution in \texttt{p2.ipynb} and attach the final plots below.

{\bfseries You will recieve no points for using third-party PCA implementations (i.e. {\normalfont \texttt{scikit-learn}}).}

{\bfseries You will recieve no points for code not included below.}
\begin{enumerate}

\item Compute the PCA. Plot the eigenvalues corresponding to the most
  significant 500 components in order from most significant to
  least. Make another plot that describes the cumulative proportion of
  variance explained by the first $k$ most significant components for
  values of $k$ from 1 through 500.  How much variance is explained by
  the first 500 components?  Describe how the cumulative proportion of
  variance explained changes with $k$.  Include this plot below.

\item Plot the mean image of the dataset and plot an image
  corresponding to each of the first 10 principle components.  How do
  the principle component images compare to the cluster centers from
  K-means? Discuss any similarities and differences.  Include these
  two plots below.

  \textit{Reminder: Center the data before performing PCA}

\item Compute the reconstruction error on the data set using the mean
  image of the dataset.  Then compute the reconstruction error using
  the first 10 principal components.  How do these errors compare to
  the final objective loss achieved by using K-means on the dataset?
  Discuss any similarities and differences.

  For consistency in grading, define the reconstruction error as the squared L2
  norm averaged over all data points.

\item Suppose you took the original matrix of principle components
  that you found $U$ and multiplied it by some rotation matrix $R$.
  Would that change the quality of the reconstruction error in the
  last problem?  The interpretation of the components?  Why or why
  not?

\end{python}

\subsection*{Problem 2.1}

Nearly all of the variance is explained by the first $500$ components. The cumulative proportion of variance explained increases at a decreasing rate as $k$ increases, reaching a ``hump'' at around $k=50$ and quickly plateauing.

\subsection*{Problem 2.2}

The PC images are very different than the cluster centers from k-means on the un-standardized data set (from Homework 4 Problem 2). Where the un-standardized k-means images are clear numbers, the PC images are blurred and with the exception of PC 0 do not look like numbers.

Interestingly, the PC images look somewhat similar to the cluster centers from k-means when the data is standardized: the edges are mostly grey and most of the variance occurs in the center. However, whereas the k-means cluster centers generally like distinct and clear numbers, the PC images do not and look like an assembly of white and black splotches (again with the exception of PC zero).

\subsection*{Problem 2.3}
The reconstruction error using the mean was $3,436,024$ and the reconstruction error using the mean and the top $10$ principal components was $1,731,315$. This is around half of the k-means mean objective loss when the data was not standardized, which (from Homework 4 Problem 2) was around $2,550,000$. These reconstruction errors are all roughly similar, with the mean and top $10$ principal components performing best.

\subsection*{Problem 2.4}
Multiplying the matrix of principle components $U$ by some rotation matrix $R$ would change the reconstruction error. The principal components are in the axes of the highest variance in the data: by rotating the principal components, they would no longer represent the axes of highest variance (the one exception being the rare instance where they were rotated orthogonally), thus changing the interpretation of the components as well, and so would yield completely different reconstructed images.

\begin{problem}[Bayesian Networks, 10 pts]

% FDV: I think we can keep this problem as-is, and just clarfiy based
% on notes from last year.
% # problem 3 clarifications
% The phrasing of Q3 is slightly off because it implies that you need to explain why each path is not blocked in the case that two nodes are not independent. It is sufficient to provide a single unblocked path. Better phrasing is (emphasis added) "Use the concept of d-separation to answer the questions and show your work (i.e., state what the blocking path(s) is/are and which node blocks the path; or explain why there exists a path that is not blocked)." 
% 
% Some helpful resources for d-separation:  The 2020 Section 8 notes, Bishop p. 372 - 379, Section 8.2 of the CS 181 textbook
% 
% Problem 3: Make it clear (put the instructions in one place) that we require explanations for both "yes" and "no" answers

  
  \noindent In this problem we explore the conditional independence
  properties of a Bayesian Network.  Consider the following Bayesian
  network representing a fictitious person's activities. Each random
  variable is binary (true/false).

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
  node distance=1cm and .5cm,
  bn/.style={draw,ellipse,text width=2cm,align=center}
    ]
    \node[bn] (w) {\attr{Weekend}};
    \node[bn,below right=of w] (t) {\attr{Traveling}};
    \node[bn,right=of t] (s) {\attr{Sick}};
    \node[bn,below left=of w] (f) {\attr{Friends over}};
    \node[bn,below right=of f] (eef) {\attr{Eat exotic foods}};
    \node[bn,right=of eef] (gs) {\attr{Get sleep}};
    \path (w) edge[-latex] (t)
    (w) edge[-latex] (f)
    (f) edge[-latex] (eef)

    (t) edge[-latex] (gs)
    (s) edge[-latex] (gs)
    (s) edge[-latex] (eef);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The random variables are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \attr{Weekend}: Is it the weekend?
\item \attr{Friends over}: Does the person have friends over?
\item \attr{Traveling}: Is the person traveling?
\item \attr{Sick}: Is the person sick?
\item \attr{Eat exotic foods}: Is the person eating exotic foods?
\item \attr{Get Sleep}: Is the person getting sleep?
\end{itemize}

\medskip

For the following questions, $A \perp B$ means that events A and B are
independent and $A \perp B | C$ means that events A and B are independent
conditioned on C.

\textbf{Use the concept of d-separation} to answer the
questions and show your work (i.e., state what the blocking path(s) is/are and what nodes block the path; or explain why each path is not blocked).

\textit{Example Question:} Is $\attr{Friends over} \perp \attr{Traveling}$? If NO, give intuition for why.

\textit{Example Answer:} NO. The path from Friends over -- Weekend -- Traveling is not blocked following the d-separation rules as we do not observe Weekend. Thus, the two are not independent. 

\textbf{Actual Questions:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Is $\attr{Weekend} \perp \attr{Get Sleep}$?
  If NO, give intuition for why.

\item Is $\attr{Sick} \perp \attr{Weekend}$?
  If NO, give intuition for why.


\item Is $\attr{Sick} \perp \attr{Friends over}\given \attr{Eat exotic
  foods}$? If NO, give intuition for why.


\item Is $\attr{Friends over} \perp \attr{Get Sleep}$? If NO, give
  intuition for why.

\item Is $\attr{Friends over} \perp \attr{Get Sleep} \given
  \attr{Traveling}$? If NO, give intuition for why.

\item Suppose the person stops traveling in ways that affect their
  sleep patterns.  Travel still
  affects whether they eat exotic foods.  Draw the modified network. (Feel free to reference the handout file for the commands for displaying the new network in \LaTeX).

\item For this modified network, is $\attr{Friends over} \perp
  \attr{Get Sleep}$? If NO, give an intuition why.  If YES,
  describe what observations (if any) would cause them to no longer be
  independent.

\section*{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item NO. The path from Weekend -- Traveling -- Get sleep is not blocked following d-separation rules as we do not observe Traveling, and so they are not independent. Intuitively, if do not observe Traveling, then whether or not it is the Weekend will affect whether or not we got sleep.
  \item YES.
  \item NO. By d-separation rule 4, since eating exotic food is a child of both Friends over and Sick and we observed Eat exotic food, then Friends over and Sick are not independent. Intuitively, observing eating exotic food gives us information about both whether or not we had friends over or were sick, so they are no longer independent.
  \item NO. By d-separation rule 3, since Weekend was not observed, Friends over is a child of weekend, and Get sleep is a descendant of Weekend, then they are not independent. Intuitively, if we observed eating exotic foods then we have information about having friends over and being sick, and since being sick affects our sleep then they are not independent.
  \item YES.
  \item The modified network:
  \begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[
          node distance=1cm and .5cm,
          bn/.style={draw,ellipse,text width=2cm,align=center}
            ]
            \node[bn] (w) {\attr{Weekend}};
            \node[bn,below right=of w] (t) {\attr{Traveling}};
            \node[bn,right=of t] (s) {\attr{Sick}};
            \node[bn,below left=of w] (f) {\attr{Friends over}};
            \node[bn,below right=of f] (eef) {\attr{Eat exotic foods}};
            \node[bn,right=of eef] (gs) {\attr{Get sleep}};
            \path (w) edge[-latex] (t)
            (w) edge[-latex] (f)
            (f) edge[-latex] (eef)
            (t) edge[-latex] (eef)
            (s) edge[-latex] (gs)
            (s) edge[-latex] (eef);
            \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
  \item YES, Friends over is independent to Get sleep in this modified network. Observing Eat exotic foods would cause them to be no longer independent. This is because by d-separation rule 4, observing Eat exotic foods would cause Friends over and Sick to no longer be independent, and since Get sleep is a child of Sick then it would also not be independent of Friends over.
